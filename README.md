## üöÄ Recent Updates

### v2.10.0 (Latest)
**New Features & Enhancements:**

### v2.9.0
**Bug Fixes & Enhancements:**
- **Animation Smoothness**: Implemented a `slowAnimationTime` variable to drastically reduce animation speeds across all patterns, ensuring very subtle and fluid visual changes, preventing jitteriness.

### v2.8.0
**Bug Fixes & Enhancements:**
- **Animation Smoothness**: Further reduced animation speeds for all animated patterns to ensure very subtle and fluid visual changes, preventing jitteriness.

### v2.7.0
**Bug Fixes & Enhancements:**
- **Animation Smoothness**: Reduced animation speeds for all animated patterns to prevent jitteriness and improve visual fluidity.

### v2.6.0
**New Features & Enhancements:**
- **Animation Feature**: Added an 'Animate Pattern' checkbox to enable subtle, evolving animations for patterns, including global rotation, noise evolution, and parameter variation for chaotic systems.

### v2.5.0
**Bug Fixes & Enhancements:**
- **Save Patterns Fix**: Resolved an issue where saving patterns would fail due to exceeding local storage limits by no longer storing redundant SVG data.

### v2.4.0
**New Patterns & Enhancements:**
- **De Jong Attractor**: Added a new pattern based on strange attractors, generating chaotic yet beautiful single-line forms.
- **Cellular Automata**: Implemented a pattern based on 1D elementary cellular automata (Wolfram rules), creating emergent, rule-based designs.
- **L-System Growth**: Introduced a pattern that generates fractal-like branching structures using L-systems.

### v2.3.0
**New Features & Enhancements:**
- **Custom Gradients**: Added a new color mode with two pickers to define a custom linear gradient.
- **Fractal Noise Pattern**: Implemented a new, more advanced noise pattern using Fractal Brownian Motion for richer textures.
- **Artistic Color Palettes**: Added a new color mode with curated, artist-inspired palettes for more sophisticated designs.
- **Perlin Displacement Pattern**: Implemented a new pattern generator that uses Perlin noise to create organic, flowing textures.
- **Pattern Layering**: Added the ability to layer multiple patterns on top of each other to create complex compositions. Exported SVGs retain these layers as `<g>` groups.

### v2.1.0
**UI Refactoring:**
- Redesigned the controls panel into a tabbed interface to improve usability and eliminate scrolling.
- Grouped controls into logical tabs: "Pattern", "Adjust", "Canvas & Color", and "Actions".

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Select a pattern type from dropdown or click preview thumbnails
3. Adjust parameters using the control panel (now including generation buttons in the 'Adjust' tab).
4. Choose format preset or custom dimensions and a color mode.
5. Click **"Generate New"** to create a base design.
6. To layer patterns, select a new pattern type/color and click **"Layer Pattern"**.
7. Save your favorite patterns to the library and export in your preferred format.

### Local Development
```bash
# Start a local server (optional)
cd "Optical art examples"
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open browser to
http://localhost:8000
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### How to Layer Patterns
Layering allows you to combine multiple patterns into a single, intricate design.
1. **Create a Base**: Generate a pattern you like using the "Generate New" button.
2. **Select a New Pattern**: Choose a different pattern from the dropdown menu.
3. **Adjust Settings**: Change the complexity, colors, or other parameters for the new layer.
4. **Click "Layer Pattern"**: This will draw the new pattern on top of the existing one.
5. **Repeat**: You can add as many layers as you like to build up complexity.

### For Laser Engraving (LightBurn)
- **Color Mode**: Black Lines only
- **Export Format**: SVG (includes proper millimeter dimensions)

### For Digital Wallpapers
- **Color Modes**: Use any of the color modes for visual impact.
- **Export Format**: PNG for best quality

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Mathematical Principles
- **Displacement Field Theory** - Lines follow calculated force fields
